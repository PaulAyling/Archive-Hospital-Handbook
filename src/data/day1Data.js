<p>When in hospital there are two tasks that can become quite difficult below are some suggestions that I hope will make them both easier.</p>
<ul>
<li className="text-small">Providing updates with concerned relatives and family</li>
<li className="text-small">Support when you talk to doctors</li>
</ul>

<h1>Communication with concerned relatives and family</h1>
<p>You probably have some people that are concerned about how you are getting on in hospital. </p>
<p>Providing updates on your condition can be hard work and if your updates are unclear or not correct it can lead to a lot of extra time and stress clarifying things. For everyones well being it is important that this is done quickly and effectively.</p>

<p>The best way of dproviding updates is a group text, email or whatsapp message sent out daily. If you do this you should let at least one person know how they can contact the hospital ward directly to get updates if you are unnavailable</p>

<p>A better way, if you can, is to have someone else communicate with you and if necessary the hospital and write an update daily and send it out on your behalf. </p>

<h1>Support when you talk to doctors</h1>

<p><strong>From friends or family: </strong>
If you use the "Doctors meetings Notes" in the book that should help a great deal to amle the meeting more productive and less stressfull. On some occasions though if the meeting is important it can be helpful if to have someone to attend these meetings with you to take notes and ask questions. This can be done in person or by the phone. That person could be a friend or family or a proffessional "patient advocate"</p>

<p><strong>From a patients advocate:</strong>
If you can't get a friend or family to help you can often get patients advocates which are often retired doctors or nurses that can help you to understand the doctor and ask questions on your behalf. Depending on where you are they may be offered for free or be hired privately.</p>
