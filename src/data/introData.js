        <h1 class=''>It started in an Ambulance... </h1>
     
          <p>
            Recently I found myself in an ambulance travelling across Thailand
            with a suspected heart attack. This was just the beginning of a
            journey which took me to three hospitals in three countries. At the
            same time my uncle was about to be released from hospital with a
            dangerous condition that only through his management of the
            situation was prevented.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was prepared to feel sick and scared about my illness, but was not
            prepared for a host of other difficulties I would experience while
            in hospital. After speaking with my uncle and others, I could see
            that the problems I experienced were shared by many.{' '}
          </p>

          <p>
            The last thing I wanted to do was think through problems and create
            solutions while I was in hospital, but eventually I started to
            figure things out and get organised. As I progressed in setting up
            systems and managing things, management of my stay became much
            easier.

            Now I have done the work, at least I know that next time my stay
            will much easier to manage. I hope others can benefit from my work
            as well. This is the reason I wrote this book.

          <h1>The Purpose of this book</h1>
          <p>
            The purpose of this book is to reduce the amount of things you need
            to remember or manage when you are in hospital. That way you can
            focus on rest whilst feeling your recovery is moving in the right
            direction.

          <h1>What is this book?</h1>
          <p>
            The book design is based on my experience and feedback from patients

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Simple: </strong> It should take 10 mins or less of simple
            reading before you can get started.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An Organiser: </strong>All you need is a pen to start
            managing things more effectively.
          </p>
